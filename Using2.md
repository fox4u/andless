There are three playback modes in this version:

  1. old mode which requires the root access to the device (ROOTED DEVICES ONLY!);
  1. default mode for lossless files which uses internal Android API and doesn't require root access;
  1. playback of lossy files (mp3, ogg, etc.) supported in Android (via the standard SDK API).

The switching between 1) and 2) is through "Direct hardware access" checkbox in Settings menu (you may need to restart the program in a new mode if it doesn't work right away).
The switching between 1,2) and 3) is of course automatic.

Contrary to what I expected, I haven't noticed significant performance degradation in non-direct access mode.

Of course, if you have a rooted device, you'd better stick to direct access just to save CPU and memory.

In non-root modes, use the hardware button to control the volume (UI buttons are disabled).
