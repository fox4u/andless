I'm very grateful to the developers of lossless audio formats
  * APE (http://www.monkeysaudio.com)
  * FLAC (http://flac.sourceforge.net)
  * Musepack (http://www.musepack.net)
  * WavPack (http://www.wavpack.com)

My special thanks to the Rockbox team (http://www.rockbox.org) whose
excellent code was most extensively used.<br>
In my opinion, it's the best code ever written for mobile devices.<br>
<br>
And, of course, I'm very grateful to the members of the famous FFMPEG Project (<a href='http://www.ffmpeg.org'>http://www.ffmpeg.org</a>).<br>
We couldn't ever have any decent audio or video on our computers without their efforts.
