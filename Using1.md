# CUE support #

CUE files may be based on any supported audio files (i.e., wav, flac, ape, wv or mpc).
Their encoding must be either ASCII or UTF-8 (the same also applies to playlists).

As the CUE format itself is not standardised, some programs write curious cue files.
My parser is too simple to handle that; however, it understands almost all cues I have (several hundred).

In particular, all cues generated by EAC should play without problems.

Track seeking in mpc-based cues (mpc ver.8 is not supported) may be a bit laggy and not overly accurate (+/-3s), but there's nothing to do with that.

# Playlists support #

Playlists are actually ordinary text files with ".playlist" extension, each line being an **absolute** path to some audio file.

You can create them manually on the device, e.g.,
```
find /sdcard/dir -name \*.flac -o -name \*.ape > /sdcard/dir.playlist
```
or as described below.

M3U and PLS playlists with relative paths are also recognised, but **may** be parsed incorrectly (I have just a few such files).

To create a playlist or to add files to it, long-press a directory or a file you want to add.

(E.g., to create a playlist with **all** your music files, go to "/", long press sdcard, check "Recursive", and click "Add").

CUE tracks or playlists cannot be added to a playlist. If you long-press CUE or playlist, it'll start playing immediately without going inside it: this was intended for those who like the "shuffle" feature selectable from Menu->Settings (only playlists are shuffled, not CUEs or directories).

To edit a playlist, go inside it and long-press a file you want to move or delete.
If you edit M3U or PLS playlists, they'll be converted and saved with ".playlist" extension.
